        Each species comes, of course,<br>

        <br>
        The long-suspected meanings<br>
        of rustlings, chirps, and growls!<br>
        Soliloquies of forests!<br>
        The epic hoot of owls!<br>
        Those crafty hedgehogs drafting<br>
        aphorisms after dark,<br>
        while we blindly believe<br>
        they are sleeping in the park!<br>

<!--         Time retains
        its sacred right to meddle
        in each earthly affair.
        Still, time’s unbounded power
        that makes a mountain crumble,
        moves seas, rotates a star,
        won’t be enough to tear
        lovers apart: they are
        too naked, too embraced,
        too much like timid sparrows.

        Old age is, in my book,
        the price that felons pay,
        so don’t whine that it’s steep:
        you’ll stay young if you’re good.
        Suffering doesn’t insult the body.
        Death? It comes in your sleep,
        exactly as it should.

        When it comes, you’ll be dreaming
        that you don’t need to breathe;
        that breathless silence is
        the music of the dark
        and it’s part of the rhythm
        to vanish like a spark.
        Only a death like that. A rose
        could prick you harder, I suppose;
        you’d feel more terror at the sound
        of petals falling to the ground.

        Only a world like that. To die
        just that much. And to live just so.
        And all the rest is Bach’s fugue, played
        for the time being
        on a saw. --></p></div>
