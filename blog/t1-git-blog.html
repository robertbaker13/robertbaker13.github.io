      Version Control allows developers to track changes in the code they develop over time. As bugs emerge and are fixed, new features added, more bugs emerge and are fixed, and so on, it becomes increasingly important to be able to look back on various states the code has existed in previously. Knowing which changes were made, when, and by whom, gives developers great power. Imagine a massive project with many dozens of developers working for years, when a serious bug is discovered. This bug was not always present, and it could exist almost anywhere among many thousands of lines of code. Version control allows a developer to crawl backward through time, checking exactly which version update caused the bug, narrowing its potential location from almost anywhere to a very specific block of code added on a particular day by a particular developer. The offending code can be altered to elminate the bug with far fewer hours of work. The developer fixing the code knows exatly when the bug first arose, what the offending code was supposed to do, who added it and why.

      Git in particular helps developers keep track of changes by recording all changes made to a particular set of files, called a repository.  "Branches" can be split off from the timeline of this repository and its recorded changes, and the changes made to multiple branches can be merged together, with Git keeping track of each change that occurs in each branch of the timeline.  Repositories themselves can be similarly split off and merged back together both locally and over networks, by "cloning" (copying a remote repository), "fetching," (downloading changes to a remote repository) "merging," (updating the local repository with the downloaded changes), and "pushing" (sending local changes to a remote repository).

      GitHub builds upon the already powerful set of tools that Git provides by giving developers a central place to store, work on, and share repositories. This means that each time a new repository is started on GitHub, it is quickly and easily accessible by other developers, who can use this central location as a hub for their project, each working locally but remaining connected to the central repository hosted by GitHub. This makes collaboration far simpler than forcing developers to have to swap URLs for copies of repositories that they each have to host themselves on a server somewhere.  In fact, GitHub makes collaboration so easy that developers can collaborate with total strangers! GitHub also adds a ton of visual features to the Git interface for the repositories stored there, which is ideal for a shared repository, since most of the command-line work is done on individual developers' machines, and having a clean, graphical interface is ideal for the higher-level taks that involve managing multiple contributions to code as opposed to the actual coding itself.
