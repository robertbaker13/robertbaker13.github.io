      Please note - this content is not original.  I posted these paragraphs to complete an assignment on time, but I intend to go back and add original material below ASAP.  For now, read an excerpt from <a href="http://www.impressivewebs.com/inline-block/">What is Inline-Block?</a> by Louis Lazaris.

    <p>
      If you’ve been developing with CSS for some time now, you’re certainly familiar with the inline-block value for the display property. The most common use for this property/value pair is when getting IE6’s margins to behave.

    </p>
    <p>
      To briefly explain what I’m talking about, if you float an element in IE6 and give it a margin setting on the same side as the direction of the float, the margin will (strangely) be doubled. You could fix this with an IE6 hack with a margin setting that’s half the value of the original, or you could (in many cases) give the element’s display property a value of inline-block (again in an IE6-only hack or stylesheet). This will resolve the issue in most, if not all circumstances.
    </p>
    <p>
      Although this IE6 workaround for floated elements has probably been the most useful way to implement the inline-block value, it could serve a much more legitimate purpose if the value itself is better understood.
