        I think the biggest problem facing the tech industry today has got to be a shortage of good coders. For every problem that someone is trying to solve with a new app or a new piece of programmable technology, I feel like we can all count at least 20 others that nobody has even found the time or resources to attack yet.
    </p>
    <p>
        And for each 100 problems someone IS actively trying to solve with an app, the number of well-executed solutions is probably far less than 1.  It's a gold rush right now, but there are an awful lot of prospectors out there that don't seem to know what gold looks like.
    </p>
    <p>
        This problem is twofold - an absence of good coders is both a shortage and an abundance.  The shortage is obvious, of course - but the abundance is of not-good coders.  An indutry that is hiring like crazy and pays well is calling people from all over to join in.  Coding bootcamps are an obvious side effect of this - no other industry that I can think of is in such demand right now that firms would be willing to hire people who have 20 weeks of training for jobs that until very recently demanded at least a Bachelor's Degree!
    </p>
    <p>
        Of course, that's good news for us, right?  Plenty of opportunity for those clever and motivated enough to get into the industry while the getting is good.
    </p>
    <p>
        I think it behooves us, however, to keep an eye on the two prongs of this problem - as more good coders enter the market, and as the market stabilizes, the ability for the not-so-good coder to keep reaping the benefits of this untenable situation will undoubtedly begin to wane.
    </p>
    <p>
        Getting in fast is important - the window we're seeing will probably close (who can tell how soon?) - but if we can't get a grasp on the industry and learn to make ourselves the kind of coders that employers will want to keep around when it's time to trim the fat, getting in quickly isn't really enough to build a career out of this.  We'll need staying power!
    </p>
    <p>
        I'm quite curious, then, to get to know more people in this industry.  I want to hear their complaints about their fellow developers.  Which types of people are indispensable, and why?  Which types will be the first against the wall?  Let's get all the gossip...
