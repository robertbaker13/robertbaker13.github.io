        Pairing takes some getting used to, but once one gets the hang of it, it's a fun way to learn a very important side of the business we are all trying to get into - talking about coding.  As we get better and better at the actual coding, it's imperative that we be able to communicate about it intelligently, clearly, and concisely.  We want to be good coworkers, communicative and expressive.  Many times I think I have learned something thoroughly, only to attack it in a pairing session to realize that I know the concepts but not how to accurately describe them!

        Feedback is a little trickier - often times I feel that the feedback I'm giving and getting is all a little too vague and a little too friendly to be as helpful as it could be.  Partially, I think this is because we all have a sense of camaraderie - that we are in this together - which leads us to try to be as encouraging as possible.  I'm looking forward to getting more feedback from instructors when we enter Phase 1.

        I think the concept of Feedbackinate is great - rating feedback anonymously as a filter to prevent unhelpful feedback from being passed on is a powerful way to crowdsource a useful task - filtering - while also exposing the entire group to other ways of making criticism that is not directed at them, which helps us all be objective about the criticism we are giving!

        I hope to get even better at giving and receiving criticism, and I definitely feel it has helped me pair, although I think just getting more practice, both at pairing itself, and with solo coding.
