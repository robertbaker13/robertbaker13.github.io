        <p>In the Gregorc Mind Styles model, I'm an ABSTRACT SEQUENTIAL thinker.</p>

        <p>Not by a small margin, either - I fall very squarely into this camp, and the profile it gives of me seems pretty accurate.  I found myself agreeing with most of the descriptors of my personality type and learning experiences.</p>

        <p>I did some research into the Gregorc model and stumbled upon an academic paper, however, that made me question what this model says about me.</p>

        <p>About how firmly I fell into one camp, I encountered this critique of the Gregorc model: </p>

        <p><code>[t]he structure of the Delineator's protocol makes it extremely easy for the individual completing the test to "decipher" how the test works. This greatly enhances the probability that, after an individual rates one or two sets of words, a conscious or unconscious effort will be made to rate the rest of the word sets consistently, creating spuriously high Alpha coefficients.</code></p>

        <p>Come to think of it, I remember pretty clearly taking this test and after a few questions starting to sense a certain pattern to the answer options.  I certainly felt a certain amount of pressure to test consistently - times when I felt hung up by an answer, I always chose the one that I felt best fit with the pattern of answers I had already given.</p>

        <p>So much for the solidity of my type!  I had almost certainly done that myself, out of a desire to feel like a consistent human being.</p>

        <p>What of how accurate the descriptions seemed of my personality seemed?  Next I found this bit of criticism:</p>

        <p><code>This procedure for validating an assessment tool is much like reading your horoscope in the newspaper at the end of the day. In most instances you can recall at least one situation or event which occurred during the day wtiich corresponds to the prediction made. In fact one could probably mix-up the predictions assigned to the various astrological signs and still get a high level of agreement.</code></p>

        <p>To answer this, I went back to the four learning types and asked myself how well the other three seemed to fit with me.  And man, I have to say, a whole lot of it seemed to describe me perfectly!</p>

        <p>I don't mean to totally discredit this line of analysis, but I think it's important to take this kind of thing with a very big grain of salt.  Being aware of myself and my emotions as I plunge into a very intense learning environment is tremendously important.  But I think I can do that without necessarily buying completely into a somewhat discredited (or at least seriously challenged) theory of learning types.</p>
