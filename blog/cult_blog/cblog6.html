      As a white male, today's identity politics-heavy atmosphere can sometimes make it hard to navigate issues affecting minorities.  I have to preface every conversation with an acknowledgment that - as a white American male - I am pretty much in the luckiest group of people on the planet.
     </p>
     <p>
      That said, I have a tremendous amount of empathy for those who experience the effects of stereotype threat.  On a very basic level, it's entirely understandable.  Anxiety and distraction can create a feedback loop - one is anxious, then distracted by one's anxiety, which creates more anxiety, ad infinitum.  This is an experience I think we have all had at some point or another, although some of us are lucky enough to have fewer triggers than others when it comes to where that anxiety begins.

     <p>
      That empathy must become a strong point if I am to become a part of the solution to the problem of stereotype threat.  I must help to create an atmosphere of acceptance and safety wherever I go in this industry.  As a member of the suppressing majority - the power class, if you will - I cannot hide behind any sense of individual innocence.  I may not personally be responsible for the wealth and power imbalance that exists in this world, but that does not let me off the hook when it comes to making it right.

      I know the tech world skews heavily toward men.  I know that women and minorities are underrepresented in government and business, and that they all make a fraction of what white men make when employed doing the same tasks.  If I don't fight to make that right, then I cannot claim innocence.

      As Martin Luther King said, "History will have to record that the greatest tragedy of this period of social transition was not the strident clamor of the bad people, but the appalling silence of the good people."
