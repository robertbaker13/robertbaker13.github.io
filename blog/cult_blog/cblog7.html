    <p>Let's look at Quality.  In a list of nouns, between Recognition and Purity, we might think we are being asked about the noun Quality, as opposed to the adjective, Quality. Quality, as in, "this sandwich has many qualities," which of course could include some rather bad qualites at that.  "Makes a terrible doorstop" is a quality of most sandwiches. That's not much of a thing to be discussing in this context - it's no different from the word Value, which is at the top of the list and only indicates "a thing worthy of being in this list," which just won't do.  Instead the adjective - "that's a quality sandwich!" - seems to be what we're being asked to address, and so I will address it:</p>
    <p>I care a great deal about quality - I think we all do in some way or other.  The quality of the air I breathe is fairly important.  The quality of my paycheck is also a factor that affects my life.  When it comes to the work that I do, I care about many of its qualities - I want the work to be efficient, and enriching, and awe-inspiring sometimes.  I want the product of the work to be equally full of quality.  Quality, when it doesn't desribe a characteristic, describes a judgment of that characteristic.  It is inherently a subjective idea.  In fact, much ado about this exact subject was made by Robert Pirsig in his novel "Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance," which proposed that Quality has its own metaphysics.  That metaphysics is the basis of an entire theory of reality, which the main character slowly assembles over the course of the novel while simultanously going insane.</p>
    <p>Pirsig describes this philosophy in a novel instead of a treatise because Quality, in his mind, is a subjective experience that is destroyed the moment it is 'grasped' (whatever THAT means) by Western thought.  To simply care about Quality in one's work is to miss out on what Quality even means.  We cannot 'care about quality' in our work, because our interaction with Quality supercedes our interactions with things like 'work' or 'caring.'</p>
    <p>On this level, I suppose I care about Quality more than any of the values on this list.  You may note that items like Spiriuality and Faith were of least concern to me.  This is because, fundamentally, my notion of Quality, as inherited and interpreted from Pirsig, is closer to a religious or metaphysical idea to me than any traditional notions of Faith or Belief.</p>
    <p>The last time I was asked for advice was on the subject of drug addiction.  Or educational theories about learning types, I can't remember which.  The advice I gave was the same on both subjects, so it doesn't really matter which was more recent.</p>
    <p>The advice I gave was that Thoreau's notion that "the unexamined life is not worth living" has a counter-argument with equal validity: "to examine a life is to forgo living it." Understanding one's best educational strategy for one's learning type - or - one's best treatment strategy for ending addiction is a tool that belongs in the hands of one's doctor or teacher and not in the hands of the patient or student.  Worrying about how I learn best can distract me from the business of actually learning, just as worrying about my type of addiction prohibits me from simply living my life without the chemicals I've decided to wean myself off of.</p>
    <p>At a certain point, you just do the work.  You cram the square peg through the circle hole, if it is a circle hole, and after enough pegs have gone through, someone else (the doctor or educator, in these cases) directs you to the square hole and your task becomes all that much easier.  "Why," you may ask, "is your advice to shove a square peg through a circle hole?"  A natural reaction.  "The shaped-peg and different-shaped-hole metaphor exists precisely in counter to your argument!" is another natural reaction.</p>
    <p>But in this particular instance, I believe I am right because in OUR metaphor, the peg-pushing student/addict is deaf, dumb, and blind.  He or she is in a room full of pegs, and the walls are covered with various circular holes in all sorts of hard to find places - almost none of them square and even fewer of those the perfect square to accomodate the shape of the pegs, which by the way are falling into the room at an alarming rate from a hole in the ceiling.</p>
    <p>The point I'm making is that the poor student/addict will drown in pegs if they aren't dealt with, and the act of getting them cleared away at any pace is better than feeling about blindly around the room with almost no hope of finding the perfect hole before it is too late.  The point I'm making is that the teacher/doctor is the specialist here, the one to poke around and encourage their client to try this or that hole because of its superior shape, to direct them to become better at clearing pegs - while the client's job is to do the work of peg clearing.</p>
    <p>Stop worrying about what kind of learner you are - it will be no more helpful to your education than a quiz to learn which house of Hogwarts you belong to.  Just study, and if your studying isn't working, consider studying harder.  It's certainly true that some people learn better with one strategy and others with another, but if we take too much time to study our study methods, is infinitely easier to blame every difficulty we encounter on our 'learning type' rather than 'it's a hard thing to learn, perhaps I am not working hard enough' once we are made familiar with these 'learning types' in the first place.  In my opinion, that's technical knowledge that belongs to teachers, and it works better if the student is left out of it.</p>
    <p>After all, when one is having trouble sleeping, and one tosses and turns because nothing feels comfortable, ultimately, in order to fall asleep, one must surrender to the notion that no sleeping position will ever be perfect, that one of them will have to simply be 'good enough,' for it is long past time to stop turning and start sleeping.  The tossing and turning itself may have started as a well-intentioned effort to get to sleep, but after even a short time, it quickly becomes a distraction from sleep.</p>
    <p>I know I haven't mentioned stereotype threat by name, but I should hope that the analogies I've made are somewhat enlightening of my attitude toward the subject.  I am feeling tired and think I shall go lie down.</p>
