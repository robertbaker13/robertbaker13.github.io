      The kitchen analogy that appears <a href="http://vimeo.com/85001014"> here </a> is an interesting one.  When I talk to home cooking enthusiasts, there's a lot of discussion of recipes.  Chefs don't talk about recipes, though.  Chefs talk about knives.
    </p>
    <p>
      Why is that?  Is it that most chefs have moved past the notion of recipes?  Have they just memorized everything?
    </p>
    <p>
      Nope.  Sure, chefs have memorized a few sets of ingredients, the classics - mire poix is carrot/celery/onion. Bechamel is flour, butter, milk.  Veloux is roux and stock.  But chefs have a FEEL for food.  They don't measure out recipes because they've done it so many times it's automatic.
    </p>
    <p>
      What chefs DO when they're cooking is taste.  Taste, taste, taste.  Nothing goes out that hasn't been tasted.  Taste - needs salt.  Taste - add parsley.  Taste - needs acid.  You start with a vision of what the dish should accomplish, you build the dish, part by part, constantly testing the parts, honing them, until you're ready to plate.  The dish gets constructed, adjusted, garnished.
    </p>
    <p>
      And when they're done, the most interesting thing they like to talk to each other about is not how good their Allemande sauce is, or the amount of salt they put in their demi-glace.  They talk about their knives.

      There is nothing that DBC is going to teach me that I cannot learn on my own.  I'm going to repeat that.  Nothing that DBC is going to teach me is something that I cannot learn on my own.
    </p>
    <p>
      Coding is not a secret handshake - I didn't pay my tuition to join a country club.  All this information is out there, and I can get it on my own.  The point of being here, at DBC, is to have help on the way, to have a strong, motivating force pushing me to learn all the things I need to learn, with momentum and support.
    </p>
    <p>
      To me, the way to attack my time at DBC shouldn't be about deference to someone's idea of how learning should happen.  If anything, I should be looking constantly for the man behind the curtain.  Not so I can get upset about whether I got my money's worth or not, but so that I walk away from DBC understanding all of it - the construct that was built to help me learn what I did.  DBC is a construct, slapped together by people who think they can build a place, a method, for teaching a whole lot of coding in a really short time.  We owe it to ourselves to disassemble that construct, peer at the pieces, see how it works, and observe how it works on us.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here's a project - look at this alarm clock, take it apart, put it back together again.  How does it work?  How could it do that work better?  Now look at this code.  How does it work?  Take it apart.  Nothing should be off limits in this mindset - even our own learning experience, even the school we attend, the culture we live in, the world we inhabit. Let's deconstruct everything.  To start, we'll probably need some really sharp knives.
