      <p>I'm working on the world,<br>
        revised, improved edition,<br>
        featuring fun for fools,<br>
        blues for brooders,<br>
        combs for bald pates,<br>
        tricks for old dogs.<br>
        <br>
        Here's one chapter: The Speech<br>
        of Animals and Plants.<br>
        Each species comes, of course,<br>
        with its own dictionary.<br>
        Even a simple "Hi there,"<br>
        when traded with a fish,<br>
        make both the fish and you<br>
        feel quite extraordinary.<br>
        <br>
        The long-suspected meanings<br>
        of rustlings, chirps, and growls!<br>
        Soliloquies of forests!<br>
        The epic hoot of owls!<br>
        Those crafty hedgehogs drafting<br>
        aphorisms after dark,<br>
        while we blindly believe<br>
        they are sleeping in the park!<br>
        <br>
        Time retains<br>
        its sacred right to meddle<br>
        in each earthly affair.<br>
        Still, time's unbounded power<br>
        that makes a mountain crumble,<br>
        moves seas, rotates a star,<br>
        won't be enough to tear<br>
        lovers apart: they are<br>
        too naked, too embraced,<br>
        too much like timid sparrows.<br>
        <br>
        Old age is, in my book,<br>
        the price that felons pay,<br>
        so don't whine that it's steep:<br>
        you'll stay young if you're good.<br>
        Suffering doesn't insult the body.<br>
        Death? It comes in your sleep,<br>
        exactly as it should.<br>
        <br>
        When it comes, you'll be dreaming<br>
        that you don't need to breathe;<br>
        that breathless silence is<br>
        the music of the dark<br>
        and it's part of the rhythm<br>
        to vanish like a spark.<br>
        Only a death like that. A rose<br>
        could prick you harder, I suppose;<br>
        you'd feel more terror at the sound<br>
        of petals falling to the ground.<br>
        <br>
        Only a world like that. To die<br>
        just that much. And to live just so.<br>
        And all the rest is Bach's fugue, played<br>
        for the time being<br>
        on a saw. </p>
